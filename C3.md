__Description:__ This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!  
Download the [ciphertext](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/47/ciphertext) here.  
Download the [encoder](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/47/convert.py) here.  
Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission. If the flag was "example" you would submit "picoCTF{example}". 

__Hint:__ Modern crypto schemes don't depend on the encoder to be secret, but this one does.

### encoder.py
```python
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

decrypted_text = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  decrypted_text += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(decrypted_text)
```

## Tools to SOLVE:

- `python` programming language

### My Approach from (MasterCode):
1. In Terminal of kali linux, run `python convert.py ciphertext`.
2. It will show this error,  
`cur = lookup1.index(char)`  
`^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^`  
`ValueError: substring not found`
3. Because in the cipher text, there are only alphabet included.
4. So, in the loop, first i change the destination from `lookup1` to `lookup2`.
5. Also, the `(cur - prev)` into `(cur + prev)`.
6. Then store it into `decrypted_text`.
7. Then run the `python convert.py ciphertext` again. It will show you another code snippets of python.
```python
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
8. You have to just copy the above code into the decrypted python code and the set the decrypt message into the `chars` variable.
9. Again run the `python convert.py ciphertext`. This the flag and wrap it with picoCTF{flag}

## Full Updated Code

```python
import sys

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

decrypted_text = ""
prev = 0
for char in chars:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    decrypted_char_index = (cur + prev) % 40
    decrypted_text += lookup1[decrypted_char_index]
    prev = decrypted_char_index 

print(decrypted_text)


chars = decrypted_text
b = 1

plain_text = ''
for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == (b * b * b):
        plain_text += chars[i]
        b += 1

print("picoCTF{" + plain_text + "}")
```

### flag : ~~picoCTF{sheriff_you_solved_the_crime}~~
_Note:_ Don't copy it try yourself.
